/**
 * A ServerConfig that provides three sets of addresses: listen, multicast and announce. Listen addresses are those the
 * server(s) should use for listening for incoming connections. The multicast addresses should be used to broadcast the
 * servers addresses. The addresses that should be announced are stored in announce. These are normally the same as the
 * ones used for listen, however it may be useful to add external addresses (for example, the address of a router doing
 * NAT if it has been configured to forward the necessary ports).
