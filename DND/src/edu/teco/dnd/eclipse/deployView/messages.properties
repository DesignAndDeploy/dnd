DEPLOY_COLUMN1_TOOLTIP=Deploy function block on this module, if possible. No module selected means no constraint for deployment
DEPLOY_COLUMN2_TOOLTIP=Deploy function block at this place, if possible. No place selected means no constraint for deployment
DEPLOY_COLUMN3_TOOLTIP=Module assigned to the function block by the deployment algorithm.
DEPLOY_COLUMN4_TOOLTIP=Place the function block will be deployed to.
DEPLOY_CONSTRAINTS_BLOCK_REMOVED=The block you want to constrain has been removed from the graphiti diagram.
DEPLOY_CONSTRAINTS_INFORM=The Algorithm that creates possible distributions will only provide a valid distribution, if the module you selected is at the given place. If the module's location is somewhere else or none at all, no valid deployment will be found.
DEPLOY_CONSTRAINTS_NEW=You changed some constraints on your function blocks after the current deployment was created. Keep in mind that this deployment might not fullfill your constraints anymore.\n\n Press OK to deploy anyway. Close this window to abort.
DEPLOY_CONSTRAINTS_TOOLTIP=Constrain on which module and / or place your function block should run.
DEPLOY_CONSTRAINTS_WARN=You entered both a module and a place. Keep in mind that if the module doesn't match the place, no possible distribution will be found.\n\n Press OK to constrain both module and place for this function block anyway. Close this window to abort.
DEPLOY_CREATEDISTRIBUTION_TOOLTIP=Create a deployment concerning your constraints. To actually deploy the function blocks, press the Deploy button.
DEPLOY_DEPLOYDISTRIBUTION_TOOLTIP=Deploy your application according to the displayed deployment.
DEPLOY_NO_BLOCKS=No blocks to distribute.
DEPLOY_NO_DIST_YET=No distribution created yet.
DEPLOY_NO_MODULES=No modules to deploy on.
DEPLOY_NO_VALID_DISTRIBUTION=No valid distribution exists
DEPLOY_RENAMEBLOCK_TOOLTIP=Rename the selected function block.
DEPLOY_SELECTMODULE_TOOLTIP=Select a module for this function block to run on.
DEPLOY_SELECTMODULEOFFLINE_TOOLTIP=You have to start the server to be able to select among running modules
DEPLOY_SELECTPLACE_TOOLTIP=Enter a place for this function block to run on.
DEPLOY_UPDATEBLOCKS_TOOLTIP=Reloads the function blocks from the dataflowgraph.
DEPLOY_UPDATEMODULES_TOOLTIP=Updates Information on currently available modules and running applications.
