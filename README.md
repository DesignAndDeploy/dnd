Design and Deploy
=================

Design and Deploy is a framework for developing applications that rely on intelligent environments. It handles network communication between multiple hosts so that the actual application doesn't have to care where it's physically located.

Current status
==============
Design and Deploy (or simply DND) is not useable at the moment. We're currently redesigning the network layer as the old implementation had a lot restrictions and caused many bugs. Our Eclipse plugin will also be partly rewritten.
